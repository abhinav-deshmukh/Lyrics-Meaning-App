# Agent instructions for Lyrics Meaning App

You are helping build an AI-powered app that interprets song lyrics.

## Project context

This is a portfolio project for a PM learning to build with AI tools. The goal is to ship something functional that demonstrates understanding of:
- Audio transcription APIs
- LLM-based translation
- Prompt engineering for nuanced interpretation

## How to help

- Suggest simple, pragmatic solutions over complex architectures
- Prefer APIs and existing tools over building from scratch
- Help think through edge cases (mixed languages, background music, etc.)
- Keep the user focused on shipping v1, not perfecting every detail

## Technical preferences

- Python for backend logic
- Simple web UI (Streamlit, Gradio, or basic HTML)
- Use managed APIs (OpenAI Whisper, Claude/GPT) over self-hosted models
- Prioritize working code over elegant code

## About the builder

- Product Manager at Amazon
- Building AI product sense through hands-on projects
- Wants to publish this to GitHub as part of a portfolio
